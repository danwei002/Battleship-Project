# Battleship-Project
This is a game I created with my friend as our final project for our Grade 12 Computer Science course (received a final grade of 95%). 
The game is inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)">Battleship board game></a>.
It was developed in Java using the Greenfoot IDE
